* Currently Supports:
  * ArtStation - Embeds up to X extra images (X is configurable, default 5)
  * Twitter Videos - Embeds a Twitter videoes and GIFs
    * NOTE: On the live version this is temporary until discord fixes video embeds from Twitter, may not always work as expected due to API rate limits
  * Hentai Foundry - Creates embed as none exists for site.
  * Pixiv - Posts up to X images of the set (X is configurable, default 5)
    * Pixiv Ugoira - Uploads a video with correct framerate and frametiming (Video format is configurable, requires ffmpeg)
  * FurAffinity - Creates image embed as none exists for site
  * Newgrounds - Creates embed for site as image isn't fully embeded, this also displays the rating the image has.
    * NOTE: Doesn't support embeding videos
  * e621 - Creates an embed similar to what discord embeds but with higher quality image and slightly more information
    * NOTE: This is disabled on live version as I think it doesn't add much right now
  * E(x-)Hentai - Creates an embed to preview cover art, title, current score, etc.
    * NOTE: Live version only supports e-hentai.org right now
